# System Enhancements & Tweaks

This document tracks specific improvements and tweaks needed for existing functionality.

## AI System Improvements

### LLM Prompt Engineering ðŸ”§
**Current Issue**: Basic prompts may not provide optimal variety and quality

**Required Enhancements**:
- **Different system prompts for different flows**:
  - Recipe Generation: Focus on creativity and variety
  - Recipe Modification: Focus on targeted changes and preservation of core recipe
  - Ingredient Substitution: Focus on equivalent alternatives and ratios
  - Dietary Adaptation: Focus on maintaining flavor while meeting restrictions
  
- **Temperature and top-p optimization**:
  - Generation: Higher temperature (0.8-0.9) for creativity
  - Modification: Lower temperature (0.6-0.7) for consistency
  - Fine-tune top-p for optimal variety without nonsense
  
- **Enhanced behavior guidelines**:
  - Safety restrictions for harmful ingredients
  - Quality standards for recipe completeness
  - Consistency requirements for formatting
  - Variety encouragement to avoid repetitive outputs

### Recipe Search & Ranking ðŸ”§
**Current Issue**: Search preferences are binary filters instead of weighted ranking

**TWEAK Required**:
- **Preference-based ranking instead of filtering**:
  - User preferences should boost results to top, not exclude others
  - Show preferred cuisines/diets first in search results
  - Still show non-preferred items, just ranked lower
  
- **Allergy handling (hard filter)**:
  - **NEVER return recipes that contain user allergens**
  - This is a safety requirement, not a preference
  - Hard exclusion of allergen-containing recipes
  
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Weighted scoring system: base_score + preference_boost
  - Allergy filter applied before ranking
  - Sort by final weighted score

## User Experience Enhancements

### Mobile Experience Optimization ðŸ”§
**Current Issue**: Some views not optimized for desktop-first design

**Pending Work**:
- Fix all other views to be desktop-first (as noted in TODO #48)
- Ensure responsive design maintains functionality across devices
- Optimize touch interactions for mobile users
- Review and improve mobile navigation patterns

### Privacy Controls ðŸ”§
**Current Issue**: Limited user control over data visibility

**Enhancement Needed**:
- Add privacy toggle for dietary preferences visibility (TODO #33)
- Allow users to control what profile information is public
- Implement granular privacy settings for recipe sharing
- Default to private for sensitive health information

## SEO & Discovery ðŸ”§
**Business Requirement**: Improve web platform discoverability

**Implementation Needed**:
- **Meta tags and structured data**:
  - Recipe schema markup for search engines
  - Open Graph tags for social media sharing
  - Twitter Card metadata for recipe previews
  
- **URL structure optimization**:
  - SEO-friendly recipe URLs (/recipes/[slug] instead of /recipes/[uuid])
  - Sitemap generation for search engine indexing
  - Canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
  
- **Content optimization**:
  - Recipe page titles and descriptions
  - Image alt text for accessibility and SEO
  - Loading performance optimization
  - Core Web Vitals compliance

## System Robustness

### Error Handling & Safety ðŸ”§
**Enhancement Areas**:

1. **Food Safety Warnings**:
   - Modal warnings about AI limitations
   - Disclaimers about user responsibility for food safety
   - Allergy conflict detection and warnings
   - Harmful ingredient request rejection

2. **Comprehensive Error Recovery**:
   - Better error messages for network failures
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Offline functionality for core features

3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**:
   - Reject obviously harmful recipe requests
   - Validate recipe data before saving
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS
   - Rate limiting for abuse prevention

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy ðŸ”§
**Areas for improvement**:
- Recipe search result caching
- User preference caching
- Frequently accessed recipe caching
- Database query optimization
- CDN integration for static assets

### Database Optimizations ðŸ”§
**Query performance improvements**:
- Index optimization for search queries
- Vector similarity search tuning
- Connection pooling optimization
- Query result pagination improvements

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **SEO implementation** - Critical for web platform growth
2. **Safety warnings and modals** - User safety and liability protection
3. **Preference ranking system** - Better search experience

### Medium Priority (Following Sprint)
1. **Enhanced LLM prompts** - Better recipe quality and variety
2. **Privacy controls** - User data protection
3. **Mobile optimizations** - Better mobile user experience

### Low Priority (Future Sprints)
1. **Performance optimizations** - Scalability improvements
2. **Advanced error handling** - Enhanced reliability
3. **Caching implementation** - Performance gains

These enhancements focus on improving existing functionality rather than adding new features, ensuring a solid foundation before expanding capabilities.
