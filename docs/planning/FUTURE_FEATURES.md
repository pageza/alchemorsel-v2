# Future Features & Enhancements

This document outlines planned features for future releases, organized by priority and implementation timeline.

## High Priority Features

### Recipe Interaction Improvements

#### Targeted Recipe Modification ðŸš€
**Epic: Advanced Recipe Editing**
- As a user, I want to click/highlight specific parts of a recipe (ingredients, instructions) and ask targeted questions
- Example: Highlight "baking powder" ingredient â†’ Ask "I don't have this ingredient, what can I use instead?"
- This allows surgical edits instead of regenerating entire recipes
- Better user experience with contextual modifications

#### Enhanced Search with AI Understanding ðŸŽ¯
**Epic: Intelligent Search via MCP**
- Build internal MCP server to process search queries intelligently
- When user searches "fancy Honduran recipe", AI understands intent first
- Then builds appropriate database query for coherent results
- Much better than direct database text matching

### User Experience Enhancements

#### Safety Warnings & Modals ðŸŽ¯
**Epic: Food Safety & Responsible AI**
- Pop-up warnings about food allergies and recipe accuracy

- Outright rejection of harmful requests (e.g., motor oil in recipes)
- Educational modals about AI limitations

#### Recipe Preference System ðŸš€
**Epic: Smart Preference Handling**
- **TWEAK**: Preferences should influence ranking, not filter completely
- Show preferred items first, but don't exclude non-preferred
