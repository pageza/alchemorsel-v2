## 🗓️ **4-Week Implementation Plan**

### **Week 1: Critical System Fixes** 
*Goal: Fix broken core functionality*

#### **Day 1-2: Profile System Recovery** ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority: CRITICAL** → **STATUS: BACKEND FIXED**
- ✅ **Fix Profile Edit Forms** `ProfileView.vue + Edit Profile navigation`
  - ✅ **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: Missing `cuisine_preferences` table causing 500 errors
  - ✅ **BACKEND FIXED**: Profile API now returns complete data
  - 🔄 **FRONTEND**: Ready for integration testing with fixed backend
- ✅ **Fix Profile Data Loading** `auth.store.ts + user.service.ts`
  - ✅ **DATABASE FIXED**: Created missing table from migration 0015
  - ✅ **API WORKING**: Profile endpoint returns all dietary preferences, cuisine preferences, allergens
  - 🔄 **INTEGRATION**: Frontend can now get complete user data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ **Backend API** fixed - profile data fully available
- 🔄 **Frontend integration** testing needed (backend ready)
- 🔄 **Navigation** testing needed (backend ready)
- 🔄 **Username display** testing needed (backend ready)

**Result:** **Backend 100% complete** ✅ **VALIDATED BY TESTS**, frontend integration remains

#### **Day 3-4: AI Recipe Generation Fixes** 🔄 PARTIAL PROGRESS
**Priority: CRITICAL** → **STATUS: CRITICAL SAFETY BUG FOUND**
- 🔄 **Fix Search Algorithm** `backend/internal/service/search.go` (SECONDARY PRIORITY)
  - Similar recipe search working, but irrelevant results remain
  - Postponed to focus on safety-critical dietary restrictions
- 🔄 **Fix Nutrition Calculation** `backend/internal/service/llm.go` (IMPROVED)
  - ✅ **JSON PARSING FIXED**: No more empty nutrition values
  - ✅ **VARIETY ADDED**: Now seeing 320→400→550 calorie range

  - 🚨 **CONFIRMED**: Database has preferences, enhanced prompts created, but never sent to LLM
  - ❌ **EXECUTION FLOW**: Lines 185-204 never reached, debug logs missing

**CRITICAL SAFETY FINDING**: Dietary restrictions completely bypassed - could cause allergic reactions or violate religious restrictions
  - Implement dietary filter validation in search

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Search returns relevant recipes matching user query
- Nutrition values are calculated accurately based on ingredients
- Users with dietary restrictions see only compliant recipes
- Recipe generation respects user's dietary preferences
