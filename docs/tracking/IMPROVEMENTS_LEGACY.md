## üìã Technical Debt & Code Quality

### üîß Backend Improvements Needed
- Recipe generation prompt engineering
- User authentication middleware improvements
- API response consistency

### üé® Frontend Improvements Needed
- Component loading optimization
- Router guard implementation
- Consistent component design system
- State management optimization

## üöÄ Implementation Gameplan

### üéØ **Phase 1: Quick Wins & UI Polish** (1-2 days)
**High impact, low complexity - immediate user experience improvements**

1. **Welcome Message Personalization** ‚è±Ô∏è *30 mins*
   - Extract first name from email or use actual name field
   - Update all components that display username
   - **Why first**: Simple change, big UX impact

2. **Navigation Consistency** ‚è±Ô∏è *2-3 hours*
   - Standardize user menu component across all pages
   - Move Dashboard to main nav bar
   - **Why early**: Affects all pages, better to standardize before other UI work

3. **Dietary Preferences Display Fix** ‚è±Ô∏è *1 hour*
   - Debug why "paleo" isn't showing on Dashboard
   - Check API response format and frontend parsing
   - **Why quick**: Likely a simple data mapping issue

### üéØ **Phase 2: Core Functionality** (2-3 days)
**Medium-high impact, addresses core product issues**

4. **Recipe Variety Issue** ‚è±Ô∏è *4-6 hours* ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ Improved LLM prompt engineering for diverse recipes
   - ‚úÖ Added variety enforcement mechanisms with randomized elements
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced single and batch recipe generation
   - **Why important**: Core product functionality affecting user satisfaction

5. **Profile Page Integration** ‚è±Ô∏è *3-4 hours*
   - Connect to actual user data APIs
   - Enable editing of profile fields
   - **Why now**: Builds on dietary preferences fix, needed for full user experience

### üéØ **Phase 3: Access Control & Security** (1-2 days)
**High importance for proper app behavior**

6. **Access Control Implementation** ‚è±Ô∏è *3-4 hours*
   - Update router guards to restrict unauthenticated access
   - Only allow landing page for non-authenticated users
   - **Why after UI**: Need consistent navigation before restricting access

7. **Landing Page Featured Recipes** ‚è±Ô∏è *2-3 hours*
   - Show non-clickable recipe previews for unauthenticated users
   - Add "Login to view" overlays
   - **Why with access control**: Part of the same user flow

### üéØ **Phase 4: Performance & Infrastructure** (2-3 days)
**Important but can be done after core functionality**

8. **Navigation Lag Investigation** ‚è±Ô∏è *4-6 hours*
   - Profile component loading times
   - Implement code splitting/lazy loading
   - Add loading states between routes
   - **Why later**: Complex debugging, app should function first

9. **Database Seeding Improvements** ‚è±Ô∏è *3-4 hours*
   - Create batch job using actual registration APIs
   - Ensure proper authentication flow
   - **Why later**: Development workflow improvement, doesn't affect users

### üéØ **Phase 5: Information Architecture Decision** (Discussion)

10. **My Favorites Page Evaluation**
    - Discuss and decide on information architecture
    - Implement based on decision
    - **Why last**: Requires product decision, affects navigation structure

## üìä **Implementation Priority Rationale:**

- **Start with UI/UX fixes**: Quick wins build momentum, user-facing improvements show immediate value
- **Core functionality next**: Recipe variety directly affects user satisfaction, profile integration enables full user experience  
- **Access control third**: Security is important but app should work properly first
- **Performance last**: App should function correctly before optimizing, performance issues don't block core functionality
